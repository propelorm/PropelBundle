This is the official implementation of [Propel](http://www.propelorm.org/) in Symfony2.

## Branching model

### Propel1 integration

The two major branches being supported are:

* The `1.5` branch contains Propel *1.6+* integration for Symfony *2.8 LTS*.
* The `1.6` branch contains Propel *1.6+* integration for Symfony *3.0*.
* The `1.7` branch contains Propel *1.7+* integration for Symfony *4.0*.

If you are running on an older version, you may require one of the following versions of this bundle.

* The `1.0` branch contains Propel *1.6* integration for Symfony *2.0*.
* The `1.1` branch contains Propel *1.6* integration for Symfony *2.1*.

**Note:** the `master` branch won't be updated anymore, and will trigger an `E_USER_DEPRECATED` error to notice people.
