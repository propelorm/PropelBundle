PropelBundle
============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/propelorm/PropelBundle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/propelorm/PropelBundle)

This is the official implementation of [Propel](http://www.propelorm.org/) in Symfony2.

## Branching model

As `Propel2` will be released in the near future, we are migrating the branching model of this bundle in advance!

* The `1.0` branch contains Propel *1.6* integration for Symfony *2.0* (*currently 2.0 branch*).
* The `1.1` branch contains Propel *1.6* integration for Symfony *2.1* (*currently 2.1 branch*).
* The `1.2` branch contains Propel *1.6* integration for Symfony *2.2* (*currently master branch*).
* The `2.0` branch will contain `Propel2` integration for Symfony *2.1*.
  We are still considering to integrate `Propel2` with Symfony *2.0*.
  In case, we will do so, there will be a `2.1` and `2.0` branch integrating the respective Symfony version!

**The 1.x branches are already available and you are encouraged to migrate your dependencies according to the listings!**

* If you depend on Symfony `master` branch, switch to the `1.2` branch.
* If you depend on Symfony `2.1` branch, switch to the `1.1` branch.
* If you depend on Symfony `2.0` branch, switch to the `1.0` branch.

**Note:** the `master`, and `2.0` branches won't be updated anymore, and will trigger a `E_USER_DEPRECATED` error to notice people.
