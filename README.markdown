PropelBundle
============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/propelorm/PropelBundle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/propelorm/PropelBundle)

This is the official implementation of [Propel](http://www.propelorm.org/) in Symfony2.

**Important:** The `master` branch follows the **Symfony2 master** branch, and uses the **Propel Bridge**.
If you want to use the bundle with a **Symfony2 version 2.x.x** (actually, a version which is not _2.1_ or above), please use the `2.0` branch.


Currently supports:

 * Generation of model classes based on an XML schema (not YAML) placed under `BundleName/Resources/config/*schema.xml`.
 * Insertion of SQL statements.
 * Runtime autoloading of Propel and generated classes.
 * Propel runtime initialization through the XML configuration.
 * Migrations [Propel 1.6](http://www.propelorm.org/documentation/10-migrations.html).
 * Reverse engineering from [existing database](http://www.propelorm.org/cookbook/working-with-existing-databases.html).
 * Integration to the Symfony2 Profiler.
 * Load SQL, YAML and XML fixtures.
 * Create/Drop databases.
 * Integration with the Form component.
 * Integration with the Security component.
 * Propel ParamConverter can be used with Sensio Framework Extra Bundle.
 * Schema Inheritance
